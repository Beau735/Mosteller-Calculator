# Mosteller-Calculator

Formula for calculating body surface area (especially for children and adolescents): 
BSA [m2] = (height [cm] â‹… body weight [kg] : 3600)

The Mosteller formula was established in 1987 by the American physician Robert D. Mosteller and represents a simplifying 
modification of the Gehan-George formula. It can be used universally and is also suitable for calculating the body area of
children. The Mosteller formula is the most commonly used to calculate body surface area after the classic DuBois formula 
and is gaining increasing importance thanks to its simplicity. The use of the Mosteller formula is also recommended in 
several guidelines because of its accuracy.
